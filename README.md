## Overview

In this project I mainly needed to focus on page layout, page responsiveness and app functionality.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the game depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Play the game either solo vs the computer or multiplayer against another person

## My process

1.Change background color of body.
2.Create grids.
3.Create the screens.
4.Style all the elements.
5.Create hover effects.
6.Add media queries for responsivnes.
7.Add Javascript to give functionality for two players.
8.Add Javascript to give functionality for one player against cpu.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media Queries
- Vanilla Javascript

### What I learned

While working on this project, I gained a lot of practise of using Media Queries and create responsive websites. Also it was realy good to practise using more SCSS properties. With this and other tools I gained a lot of experience and I wrote the SCSS code using mobile first approach, that worked eventually and it gave me some confidence and knowledge of making wabsites responsive. The main challenge was to use javascript to give website functionality. You can play the game with your frineds or with the cpu. After the win or tie, scores will be added and you can see your scores. In the middle of the game you also can refresh the game and start it again. At this moment I didn't used any algorithm for cpu player so you can easily win it.

### Continued development

I want to create other projects like this to finally master coding and make more dynamic, interactive and functional projects.
